Big release, breaking changes:

The easiest way to update, is add the card to a dashboard and change the generated default configuration.

New features:
 - Option to disable the center calm percentage and show the first speed range.
 - Statistics data can now be used for winddirection and windspeed entities. Not all entities support this.
 - Windspeed unit is automatic detected, see readme. Depends on the unit_of_measurement attribuut of the entity.
   If your windspeed entitiy uses an unit_of_measurement that's not recognized, please let me know. You can always configure the speedunit your self.
 - Log level configurable, level INFO can give you some more information about measurement counts and speed units detected.
Changes:
 - Beaufort is not a speedunit any more. It more like a speed range option. It can be turned on with a separate property. The Beaufort speed ranges depend on the output speed unit.
 - Wind direction speed matching logic changed:
   - When NOT using statistics, when matching a speed to a direction, the matched speed is the last measurements before the measurement time of the direction.
     So also when you get speed updates once in an hour and direction updated every second, machtes can be found.
     The direction_speed_time_diff property is not used anymore.
